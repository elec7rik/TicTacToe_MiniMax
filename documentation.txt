Introduction:
This project is based on MINIMAX algorithm applied to the game of TicTacToe. It also has a PVP mode.
It uses MINIMAX to create an AI agent that is unbeatable.
TicTacToe is a game that can end in either one of the players winning or the game may end in a draw.
Considering the two players to be O(Circle) & X(Cross).
X starts the game.
Considering X to be the Maximizer and O to be the Minimizer.
Maximizer - has to maximize the evaluation/score.
Minimizer - has to minimize the evaluation/score.
The game is considered to be drawn if the evaluation at a 'terminal state' is 0.
Terminal states are the states of a game where no legal moves can be made any further.
The game ends when it reaches a terminal state.

MINIMAX algorithm:
It is an algorithm which computes all the possible paths to the terminal position in a game tree from any current position.
Minimizer and Maximizer take turns one by one and try to make a move that improve their evaluation.
